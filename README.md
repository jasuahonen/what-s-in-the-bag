## What's in the bag?

A work in progress for golfers who enjoy posting pictures of their bag and to talk about equipment and to show off special clubs and setups.
Hoping this would be used as a Instagram-esque website for golfers to stay busy and connected during long winters. 

Built with:
Vercel v0 + Next.js + Supabase + Clerk.

Currently a local project but planning on releasing this to the public use at some point.
